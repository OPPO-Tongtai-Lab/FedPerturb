Code in blades is adapted from https://github.com/lishenghui/blades 
We mainly made the following changes on blades
1. Implemented the FLAME defense scheme
2. Implemented Constscale, minmax and minsum attack schemes, and innovatively designed Fedperturb.
3. Added several model implementations.
4. Use Dirichlet function to simulate non-iid.
